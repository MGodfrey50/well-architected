# Solution architect's checklist

The deliverables of an architect are designs and plans; an architect role is not an implementor role. An architect is an expert at translating functional and non-functional requirements to cloud design patterns, fit-for-purpose components, and designing a workload just flexible and durable enough to be used for the predicted life of the functionality. All of this while considering the operational aspects of the workload, including observability and supportability, and accounting for undesirable situations such disaster recovery. Finally, the design must be constrained by all business, financial, compliance, and organizational requirements. 

Holistic frameworks, such as the Azure Well-Architected Framework, help an architect ground themselves in a perspective in which to create these deliverables. These deliverables emerge from the key principles of being well-architected combined with using checklists, guides, decision trees, reference architectures, and assessments to inform and support decisions to support the requirements of the workload.
