# Architecture decision record

An architecture decision record (ADR) is one of the most important deliverables of a solution architect. It documents architectural decisions made throughout the design process, providing context-specific justifications and implications for each decision taking into consideration the requirements and constraints. All key decisions are well-documented including the alternatives that were considered and ruled out.

## Implementing an ADR
 
ADR should be started at the onset of a workload and maintained throughout its lifespan. Consequently, the ADR serves as an append-only log, extending beyond the initial design to include design aspects against future functional and nonfunctional requirements. This log should be readily available and stored with the workloadâ€™s documentation.

In general, an architect can help a workload team achieve recommendations of Operational Excellence by helping establish and maintain a document and asset repository. Placing all of their assets into that repository and encouraging unified adoption of a single source of truth to be used for ad-hoc reference, audits, and incident response.
