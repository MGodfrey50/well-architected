# Architecture decision record

An architecture decision record (ADR) is one of the most important deliverables of a solution architect. This record documents architectural decisions made throughout the design process and provides context-specific justifications and implications for each decision. The ADR documents all key decisions, including alternatives that were ruled out, and incorporates requirements and constraints into the documented affects of a decision.

## Implement an ADR

The ADR should be started at the onset of a workload and maintained throughout its lifespan. The ADR serves as an append-only log, extending beyond the initial design to include design aspects against future functional and nonfunctional requirements. This log should be readily available and stored with the workloadâ€™s documentation.

In general, an architect can help a workload team achieve recommendations of Operational Excellence by helping to establish and maintain a document and asset repository. Architects help teams place all of their assets into the repository and encourage the teams' unified adoption of a single source of truth to be used for ad-hoc reference, audits, and incident response.
