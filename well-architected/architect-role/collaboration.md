# Collaboration with the workload team

Delivering architecture specifications is not a one-off task. An architect should expect to engage with the workload team throughout the implementation. 

- **Provide clarity**. Architects should be readily available to provide clarity on any delivered specifications, ensuring the implementation teams remain unblocked. They should actively participate in iteration planning exercises and team meetings to address potential blockers.

- **Implementation sequencing suggestions**.  Architects understand that the journey from design to a production-ready product is iterative. They can recommend which parts of the application to implement first, enabling the workload team to learn from that experience and reapply to the remaining parts of the workload. 

- **Implementation review checkpoints**. Regular review checkpoints should be established by workload teams to compare the implementation with the architectural specification. This ensures that the design is being implemented as per specification and that specification is meeting the predicted requirements. This feedback loop can rectify any design or implementation errors. 

- **Stakeholder communication**: Architects have an established relationship with stakeholders and the business and have an intimate understanding of the workload. As such, they are often in a good position to proxy implementation team concerns or requests to negotiate changes to requirements.

- **Environment recommendations**. Workload design often extends beyond designing for production and its disaster recovery. Production is just one of many environments a workload implementation team may need. Architects can assist workload teams in right-sizing pre-production environments.

- Proof of concept. Architects frequently use proofs of concept in their designs to inform decisions in the workload architecture design deliverable. These implementations can also illustrate the actual implementation. If a proof of concept does not exist, an architect should create one before the implementation team starts development.
