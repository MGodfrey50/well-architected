# Recommendations for consolidation: CO 14

This guide describes the recommendations for consolidating workload resources and responsibility to optimize workload costs. Consolidating resources is a nuanced task, distinct from simply eliminating waste. Consolidation involves bringing together various components of a workload, such as servers, databases, applications, and responsibilities. When suitable, consolidation allows workloads to reduce redundant resources & licenses and increase density. You should also look for opportunities to consolidate workload responsibility. Using centralized resources or teams offers other opportunities to optimize workload costs. Without consolidating resources or responsibility, you might miss opportunities for cost savings through shared resources and economies of scale.

**Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Consolidate | The act of combining to meet requirements with less.|
| Resource density   | A measure of logical separation within a resource. Increased density typically equates to higher utilization through colocation of disparate components, consumers, or environments. |
| Centralized resource | A shared resource that multiple components use, rather than each having its own dedicated resource. |
| Change control | A structured methodology for managing and implementing changes.  |

## Key strategies

The primary objective of consolidation is optimization, not reduction. Consolidation involves restructuring workloads, resources, and team roles to achieve maximum cost efficiency. Unlike [eliminating workload waste](eliminate-waste.md), consolidation is a process that requires careful consideration. Almost every consolidation efforts has trade-offs and potential risks. However, consolidation efforts can have a significant positive affect on cost optimization. It's important to analyze both the potential benefits and the associated trade-offs. All consolidation strategies follow a similar blueprint:

- *Assessment*: Begin with a thorough evaluation to identify areas where consolidation might be advantageous.
- *Identification and evaluation*: Pinpoint and assess potential consolidation targets to understand if the potential cost benefits, along with other trade-offs, justify the effort needed for consolidation.
- *Communication and implementation*: If the assessment confirms that consolidation is beneficial, announce the impending changes and then execute them.

### Consolidate resources

Consolidating resources is about combining resources within a workload. It involves colocating different functionalities or consumers into a combined resource. For example, you might consolidate three web servers into a single server or three databases to a single database server. You might consolidate multiple firewalls into a single firewall that serves multiple environments. The aim is to maximize the cost efficiency of each resource by increasing resource density. You look to intensify the use of a resource and minimize resource redundancy.

Common types of services that you can consolidate include application platforms, databases, network appliances, gateways, and DDoS protection. To consolidate resources within a workload, consider these recommendations:

- *Assess the workload resources*: Assess the existing workload and its resource utilization. This includes analyzing factors such as CPU usage, memory usage, storage capacity, and network bandwidth. Identify areas where consolidation could be beneficial. It could involve optimizing resource allocation, eliminating redundant or underutilized resources, or reconfiguring the workload to run more efficiently. Consider factors such as workload dependencies, performance requirements, and scalability.
- *Identify consolidation target*: Determine the resource to consolidate on. It can be an existing resource or a new resource created within the workload. Identify any existing resources that you use for consolidation. For example, you may have underutilized servers that can accommodate some of the workload components. If no existing resources meet the consolidation requirements or if it's more beneficial to move to a new resource, consider creating a new resource for consolidation.
- *Evaluate consolidation viability*: Ensure functional and technical requirements support consolidation such as CPU, memory, growth. Avoid compromising requirements like performance, reliability, and security. For example, don't create an undesired cross-regional dependency or consolidate resources across preproduction and production environments.
- *Estimate the cost*: Understand the effort and potential complications of consolidation. You should calculate costs, including resource, licensing, and operational expenses. Consider the implications, such as potential challenges in resource monitoring due to consolidation.
- *Communicate and coordinate*: Ensure you inform all stakeholders about upcoming changes and any necessary actions they need to take. Coordinate with different teams to avoid conflicts and ensure a smooth implementation.

:::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Tradeoffs**:

- Resource consolidation result in less isolation and could create a noisy neighbor scenario in workload. Look for other ways of logical isolation and increased capacity for the hosting environment. For example, firewall capacity needs to be increased if it starts supporting multiple workloads.
- Consolidation eliminates segmentation and can increase security risk, making it easier for attackers to move horizontally. It also makes some compliance standards harder to reach. Always prioritize compliance over consolidation.
- Consolidation of resources results in less redundancy. It requires careful planning to ensure you have the right amount of reliability of the workload.

### Consolidate responsibility

Consolidating workload responsibility is about reducing the set of responsibilities that workload team has. Itâ€™s a strategic cost optimization effort that requires organizational awareness and collaboration outside the workload team. There are two principal ways to consolidate the workload team's responsibility. You can use external shared or centralized resources, choosing not to run that resource in the workload environment. You can also offload workload responsibilities to other teams in the organization and not bear the direct responsibility for those tasks or personnel.

#### Use external centralized resources

Using external centralized resources refer to shared resources outside the workload environment. For example, an organization might have a centralized gateway that serves multiple workloads. The goal is to minimize duplication and overhead. Instead of your workload having a dedicated resource, you use a shared resource to optimize costs.

- *Assess the workload resources*: Evaluate the current state of the workload and identify any areas where consolidation could be beneficial.
- *Find external opportunities*: Survey your organization to locate any pre-existing centralized resources. These resources could be potential solutions for your workload. For example, instead of setting up an independent security information and event management (SIEM) tool, you could use a shared SIEM.
- *Consider change control*: Familiarize yourself with the process of managing changes to the centralized resource. You should include the approval workflow, testing protocols, and deployment methods. Analyze potential challenges with reduced control over resource modifications.
- *Estimate the cost*: Before moving to centralized resources, it's important to clearly quantify the expected savings against the costs associated with a transition. Weigh the cost-saving benefits against these risks to make an informed decision.
- *Communicate and coordinate*: Ensure that all stakeholders are informed about upcoming changes, their effect, and any necessary actions they need to take. Coordinate with different teams to avoid conflicts and ensure a smooth implementation. Establish a mechanism for continuous feedback between teams. It helps in addressing concerns, improving collaboration, and refining processes over time.
- *Document and track changes*: Maintain detailed documentation of all approved changes, including their scope, implementation steps, and any associated risks or issues. Use a centralized system or change management tool to track and monitor the status of changes throughout their lifecycle.

:::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Tradeoff**: Over-consolidation can result in resource contention, leading to performance issues. Consolidation may limit the flexibility and agility of individual teams and workloads as they must adhere to centralized standards that could inhibit customization.

#### Offload responsibility to external teams

Offloading workload responsibilities to external teams refers to using specialized services provided by expert centralized teams, such as a security operations team. The goal is to using existing teams to offload responsibility. It not only helps with cost optimization but also ensures expertise in specific functions.

- *Evaluate team skills*: Assess the current skill set of your team. Identify any skill gaps or areas where delegating tasks to a centralized team would bring about cost efficiency.
- *Find available opportunities*: Explore your organization for available services, such as security operation team. Ensure that the centralized teams can accommodate the added responsibilities without compromising on quality.
- *Consider change control*: Familiarize yourself with how the centralized team handles changesâ€”from approval workflows and testing protocols to deployment strategies. Recognize potential challenges that might arise from having less direct control over these functions.
- *Communicate and coordinate*: Ensure that all stakeholders are informed about upcoming changes, their effect, and any necessary actions they need to take. Coordinate with different teams to avoid conflicts and ensure a smooth transition. Establish a mechanism for continuous feedback between teams. It helps in addressing concerns, improving collaboration, and refining processes over time. The  teams should familiarize themselves with each other's processes, tools, and expectations. Consider a phased transition or pilot period to ease the shift and identify potential challenges early.
- *Document and track changes*: Maintain detailed documentation of all approved changes, including their scope, implementation steps, and any associated risks or issues. Use a centralized system or change management tool to track and monitor the status of changes throughout their lifecycle.
