# Recommendations for optimizing flow costs: CO 09

This guide describes the recommendations for optimizing the cost of each workload flow. Cost-optimizing the flows in a workload involves strategically allocating and managing resources to minimize expenses while maintaining performance. This optimization is crucial as it ensures efficient utilization of invested resources, reduces unnecessary expenditures, and improves the overall return on investment for the infrastructure. If you neglect to cost-optimize the flows in a workload, you run the risk of overspending on resources, resulting in inflated operational costs and diminished profitability.

**Definition**

| Term    | Definition |
|---|----|
| Flow    | A flow refers to the sequence of actions and interactions that occur within a workload to achieve a specific goal or functionality. It involves the movement of data and the execution of various processes between different components of the workload. |
| Data flow  | Data flows refer to the movement of data within a system or between different systems.|
| System flow | The flow of information and processes within a system.                                                                                                  |
| User flow  | User flows refer to the paths or sequences of actions that users take within an application or system.|
| Decouple  | Separate a flow to use a separate resource |

## Key strategies

Invest more in high-priority flows than in lower-priority flows. Aligning flow priority and spending could involve either decoupling flows that currently share the same resource. It could also involve combining flows that have similar requirements but are run on separate resources. For example, suppose you have a web application that includes multiple flows, such as user registration, login, and data processing. All of these flows run on a single server, despite having different resource needs. To optimize both costs and performance, you might separate flows or combine flows:

- *Separate flows*: For example, you could decouple the user registration flow from the others and move it to a dedicated, lower-cost server. This flow is important but not resource-intensive, making it a good candidate for a less expensive server.
- *Combine flows*: For example, you could coombine the login and data processing flows, which both have higher resource requirements, and run them together on a high-performance server. Combining these flows allows the server to efficiently handle the resource-intensive needs of both flows. It optimizes performance and costs.

In a workload, there can be different types of flows or paths that need to be considered. This guide focuses on the following categories:

- *Data flows*: Optimizing data flows involves ensuring efficient and secure data transfer, minimizing data latency, and optimizing data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- *System flows*: Optimizing system flows involves streamlining the communication and interaction between system components, minimizing bottlenecks, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.
- *User flows*: Optimizing user flows involves improving the user experience, reducing friction points, and ensuring smooth navigation and interaction within the application or system.

### Take an inventory of flows

Understanding workload flows aids in reallocating resources effectively. The goal is to ensure that financial commitments align with high-priority flows. Here are steps to understand workload flows:

- *Document flows*: Start by documenting and listing all existing flows in your workload to grasp the comprehensive state of your system. Include every sequence of actions, data transitions, and system interactions. Familiarize yourself with every component such as external services, databases, middleware, and third-party integrations. Additionally, keep track or estimate of the volume of requests over time.
- *Visualize flows*: For a clearer perspective, represent your findings visually, perhaps through flowcharts or diagrams. Visualizations help you see the interdependencies between different components. Consider using tools, like Visio, to help the visualization process.
- *Categorize flows*: Bundle similar flows, considering attributes like their functionality (for example, authentication, data retrieval, transaction processing), criticality to business, or the resources they use, be it CPU, memory, or bandwidth.

### Prioritize the flows

Flow prioritization involves classifying flows based on their influence on business outcomes, implications on user experience, and the resources they consume. Critical flows might have higher expectations around availability, recovery, and performance due to the criticality of associated business scenarios and functionality. They often require higher levels of availability, faster recovery times, and better performance to meet workload objectives. By prioritizing flows, you can align spending to flow priority. To prioritize flows, consider the following steps:

- *Identify flow value*: When optimizing workload flow costs, it's important to identify the flow that provides the most value. You don’t want to spend more than a flow is worth. Instead of simply cutting costs, consider shifting costs to prioritize the more valuable flows. For example, your checkout flow is critical for business, but the purchase history isn't. You should allocate more resources and budget to the checkout flow.

  Low-priority flows have lower expectations around availability, recovery, and performance. You can reduce costs by choosing cheaper configuration for less performance, availability, or business continuity spending.

- *Compare against metrics*: If you’re struggling to prioritize your flows, consider availability and recovery goals you assigned to them. Critical flows often have high availability requirements and service level agreements (SLAs). Flows associated with a lower RPO and RTO are more important than flows with a higher RPO and RTO.

### Optimize independent flows

Sometimes your flows are already running on different resources. In these cases, you can evaluate and optimize spending more easily. Evaluate the components and processes involved in each independent flow and see if there are ways to optimize or simplify them. To optimize independent flows, you can follow these steps:

- *Eliminate unnecessary components*: Remove any extraneous elements that don't contribute to the flow's core functionality, thereby reducing complexity and cost.
- *Redesign the flow*: Consider redesigning the flow's architecture to enhance its efficiency. You could change the sequence of operations, reduce latency, or improve data transfer speeds, among other adjustments.
- *Choose an appropriate performance tier*: Different flows may have varying demands in terms of processing speed, memory, or other resource metrics. Make sure to choose a resource tier that aligns well with each flow's specific requirements.
- *Adjust scaling settings*: If a flow experiences variable demand, consider implementing autoscaling to dynamically adjust resources according to real-time needs, thus optimizing costs.
- *Tweak configurations*: Fine-tune other settings, such as networking or data storage options, to better align with the flow's performance and budgetary requirements.

### Optimize dissimilar flows

Dissimilar flows are flows that have different attributes. These attributes could include different computational requirements, data dependencies, I/O operations, latency sensitivity, security needs, and compliance requirements. It’s often more cost efficient to run different types of flows on separate resources. If workload flows are combined (coupled or colocated), consider separating (decoupling) them. It not only enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility but also optimizes resource costs. Decoupling allows each flow to progress autonomously, minimizing the risk of one flow affecting others. Separating flows to run on different resources can provide the flexibility you need to better align spending to flow priority.

For example, if you collocated a CRM (user flow) with a data engine (data flow). User traffic to the CRM system during office hours could slow down the data engine. When you decouple workload flows, the data engine can scale each component or service independently based on the workload demand, optimizing resource allocation and reducing costs.

### Optimize similar flows

Similar types of flows share similar attributes. Like dissimilar flows, these attributes could include computational requirements, data dependencies, I/O operations, latency sensitivity, security needs, and compliance requirements. Designing similar flows to share resources can significantly optimize costs. Here are some examples where combining similar workload flows to use the same resource can lead to substantial savings:

- *Web servers*: Instead of dedicating separate web servers for each application, consider consolidating them, especially if their traffic isn't consistently high. A shared web server, paired with a reverse proxy, can effectively manage and route traffic to multiple applications.
- *API gateways*: Rather than maintaining individual API gateways for separate microservices or applications, a centralized API gateway can streamline requests, directing them to the relevant service. It not only enhances manageability but also cuts costs.
- *Log processing*: Instead of allowing multiple applications or services to each operate their own log processing instances, consider directing them all to a shared log processing tool. This approach minimizes the number of active instances, translating to direct cost savings.
- *Authentication services*: If multiple applications deploy their own distinct authentication mechanisms, it introduces redundancy. Integrating a single sign-on (SSO) solution or a communal authentication service reduces this duplication and optimizes resource usage, leading to lower costs.

**Risk:** However, don't mistake coincidence with design. Just because two flows look similar doesn't mean they serve the same purpose. You need to understand the function and design of each flow before merging or altering them. Misinterpreting a flow based solely on its appearance can lead to unintended consequences and could disrupt the service or process it supports. If multiple flows serve the same function and there are no discernible differences in their design or intent, consider consolidating them.

### Continuously monitor flows

The nature of flows and workloads can change over time, so you need to review flow spending to ensure costs align with priorities. Evaluate the resource utilization of each flow by analyzing the compute, storage, and network usage associated with each flow. Identify any inefficiencies or areas where resources are underutilized. This analysis helps you pinpoint opportunities for cost optimization. Here are considerations when reviewing flow utilization:

- *Analyze usage patterns*: Analyze the usage patterns of the flows. Some flows might be more active during certain times of the day or month, while others might have a consistent load. By understanding these patterns, you can predict resource needs and adjust allocation to avoid bottlenecks and overprovisioning.
- *Monitor relevant metrics*: Determine the metrics that can help assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of each flow. Consider CPU utilization, data transfer costs, transaction costs, and storage footprint. Utilize monitoring tools to gather detailed metrics about resource usage and performance.
- *Consider ongoing maintenance*: Consider the cost of maintenance especially when using infrastructure-as-a-service solutions, such as virtual machines. You need to account for activities such as patching, upgrades, backups, monitoring, and security.

During the analysis, identify any inefficiencies or areas where resources aren't utilized effectively. Consider idle compute instances, unused data, and low network bandwidth. These inefficiencies can indicate opportunities for cost optimization.
