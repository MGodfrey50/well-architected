# Recommendations for optimizing personnel time: CO 13

This guide describes the recommendations for optimizing personnel time. It’s a strategic process of maximizing the productivity and efficiency of employees that are designing, implementing, and operating the workload during their working hours. It involves aligning their skills, strengths, and tasks in a manner that ensures that every hour they spend at work is used most effectively. The goal is to eliminate wasted personnel potential and capabilities. Failure to optimize personnel time could lead to employee burnout, reduced competitive edge, and lowered productivity.

**Definitions**

| Term| Definition|
|---|---|
| Technical debt | The sum of code inefficiencies a developer intentionally introduces to deliver code faster.|
| Signal| A signal refers to meaningful and relevant information that provides insights into the behavior and performance of a system or application. |
| Noise | Noise refers to irrelevant or misleading information that can distract from the actual issues or trends.|

## Key design strategies

As a rule of thumb, personnel often account for the most significant expense in a workload, underscoring the importance of efficient time management. This guide is about maximizing the potential of every hour worked. Considering that individuals can't operate around the clock, the emphasis is on ensuring that each person is more effective within their designated hours or equally effective in a reduced timeframe. The goal is to achieve better utilization of their time for the benefit of the individual and the workload.

### Define success metrics

As a first step, define the metrics to measure the success of personnel time optimization efforts. Determine the specific objectives you want to achieve through optimization. For example, reducing time spent on administrative tasks or improving response time to customer inquiries.

- *Select quantitative metrics:* Choose the metrics that align with your objectives and can be measured accurately. Consider metrics such as time saved, productivity increase, efficiency improvement, and task completion time.
- *Gather qualitative metrics*: In addition to quantitative metrics, gather feedback from personnel to measure their satisfaction with their roles. This feedback can provide valuable insights into the effects of personnel time optimization efforts on employee morale and engagement.
- *Set targets:* Set realistic and achievable targets for each selected metric. These targets should be based on the current performance levels and the desired level of improvement.

### Optimize development

Optimizing development means to refine the software development processes to achieve greater efficiency. As a result, developers can invest more time in refining features, innovating within the constraints of that particular workload, and addressing any unique challenges it presents.

#### Keep features lean

When designing and customizing features, it's important to keep them lean and simple. Avoid unnecessary complexity and configuration options that can increase the time required to develop, test, and maintain the workload. Keeping the workload simple and focused allows for easier adaptability and optimization over time.

#### Reduce build times

Reducing build times refers to the process of minimizing the time it takes to compile and generate a deployment. Shorter build times enable developers to spend less time waiting for builds to complete and allows them to focus on writing code and delivering features. It also helps ensure developers receive feedback on their code changes more quickly. Quicker feedback allows them to iterate and fix issues faster. It feeds into the agile development model. Faster build times facilitate more frequent builds, enabling teams to adopt agile development practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here are some strategies to reduce build times:

- *Optimize build configurations*: Review the build configuration settings and eliminate unnecessary steps or processes that add overhead to the build process. Checkpointed builds and combining partial builds with prebuilt builds can help reduce build times and improve efficiency. This approach allows for reusing previously built components and only building the necessary parts, leading to faster build times and reduced time investment.
- *Parallelize build tasks*: Identify tasks that can be executed simultaneously and configure the build system to run them in parallel. Take advantage of available computing resources.
- *Utilize caching*: Cache dependencies, intermediate build artifacts, and other reusable components to avoid redundant work during subsequent builds.
- *Incremental builds*: Implement techniques that allow the build system to only rebuild the parts of the deployment that have changed since the last build, avoiding unnecessary recompilation.
- *Build distribution*: If applicable, distribute the build process across multiple machines or build agents to use parallelism and reduce overall build time.
- *Infrastructure optimization*: Ensure that the build environment has sufficient resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O, to handle the build.

#### Use production mocking

By mocking components or services, developers can isolate their code for focused testing by simulating dependencies. Mocking allows developers to create specific scenarios and edge cases that are difficult or impractical to reproduce in a real production environment. It can speed up testing cycles, facilitate parallel work, and eliminate troubleshooting dependencies. Here are some approaches to implementing production mocking:

- *Utilize mocking frameworks*: Use specialized mocking frameworks or libraries that allow you to create mock objects, stubs, or fakes to replace dependencies.
- *Dependency injection*: Design the application to utilize dependency injection, allowing for easy substitution of real dependencies with mock objects during testing or debugging.
- *Service virtualization*: Employ service virtualization tools or techniques to simulate the behavior of external services or APIs, enabling testing of integrations without accessing the real services.
- *Configuration-driven mocking*: Implement a configuration-driven approach where the application's behavior can be modified through configuration settings or flags to enable mocking when needed.
- *Dynamic and conditional mocking*: Design the application to support dynamic and conditional mocking, allowing developers to switch between real and mock components based on specific conditions or scenarios.

#### Optimize the development environment

The goal is for developers to get a fast feedback loop on changes. Make the necessary technology changes to improve the development experience.

*Containerization*: Consider containerizing the workload to run locally. Containers help developers replicate the production environment locally and test their changes quickly. They allow faster iteration and debugging, leading to a more efficient development process. Containers also provide a consistent and isolated environment for running the application. It also allows for easy scaling and deployment of the application.

*Developer workstations*: An optimal developer workstation should have a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE). A good developer workstation boosts developers' efficiency, diminishing the time and resources needed for various tasks. A good IDE has intellisense, syntax highlighting tailored to the programming languages. It should support version control like Git. A well-equipped IDE allows developers to pinpoint and fix issues swiftly during development, cutting down on debugging time.

*Developer environments*: It’s vital that developers aren't overly constrained in their environment. They should possess the necessary permissions to carry out tasks without undue restrictions, ensuring they can work both efficiently and effectively.

#### Optimize preproduction environments

In general, the closer preproduction environments are to production, the more time you save. It also helps minimize risk. The closer to production you're the better you can test and validate the functionality and performance of your releases before deploying them to the production environment. It helps identify and address any issues or bottlenecks early on, reducing the risk of problems occurring in the production environment.

> :::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Tradeoff**: You need to balance personnel time with resource cost. The closer you get to production the more your environment is going to cost.

#### Reuse components and libraries

Reusable components and libraries can save developers substantial amounts of time. Instead of writing, testing, and debugging code, developers can reuse validated components and libraries and develop or fix application features faster. Make sure you provide documentation for each component or library. Store the code and documentation in a central repository like GitHub that has version control.

Additionally, use open-source software (OSS) or libraries from trusted publishers that are available in package managers, such as NuGet or Maven. These package managers provide a centralized and reliable source for accessing and managing libraries. Using trusted libraries from package managers can further enhance productivity and reduce the time spent on developing and maintaining code.

#### Remove technical debt

Removing technical debt is essential for maintaining a healthy and efficient codebase. By following specific standards and implementing mechanisms like quality gates, you can effectively address technical debt and improve the overall quality of your code. Here's how you can incorporate this guidance into your approach:

- *Allocate time for technical debt resolution*: Dedicate a portion of your development team's time to resolving technical debt. A good starting point is to allocate around 20% of the team's time specifically for addressing technical debt. The dedicated time allows developers to focus on refactoring, code cleanup, and improving the overall quality of the codebase.
- *Empower the development team*: Allow the development team to own the prioritization of technical debt resolution. They are in the best position to identify areas of the codebase that require attention and understand the effects of technical debt on workload functionality. Encourage open communication and collaboration within the team to ensure that technical debt is addressed effectively.
- *Prioritize*: Prioritize technical debt items based on their effects on workload functionality. Focus on addressing the issues that have the most significant effect on the performance, maintainability, and scalability of the workload. By prioritizing effectively, you can maximize the effects of your efforts in removing technical debt.

Removing technical debt is an ongoing process. It requires a proactive approach and continuous effort from the development team. By setting and adhering to specific standards in the codebase and implementing mechanisms like quality gates, you can effectively address technical debt and create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase:

- *Set coding standards*: Establish clear and specific coding standards that define the desired structure, style, and best practices for your codebase. These standards should cover areas such as naming conventions, code formatting, documentation, and error handling. By adhering to these standards, you ensure consistency and readability throughout the codebase.
- *Implement quality gates*: Quality gates are mechanisms that enforce the defined coding standards and catch potential issues early in the development process. They can include automated code reviews, static code analysis tools, and continuous integration pipelines. By integrating quality gates into your development workflow, you can identify and address code quality issues before they become technical debt.

### Optimize collaboration

Effective collaboration minimizes wasted time from misunderstandings or duplicated efforts, making the overall process smoother. Enhance teamwork, ensuring members work seamlessly together. Implement team-building exercises, employ collaboration tools, and regularly review team dynamics to ensure efficient communication.

- *Eliminate silos*: Silos can lead to a lack of shared knowledge and unnecessary replication of tasks. Cross-functional collaboration can save time and improve results. Break down barriers between departments or teams, promoting inter-departmental cooperation. Foster cross-departmental meetings, workshops, and joint projects. Encourage open communication channels across teams.
- *Optimize standards*: Unnecessary standards can lead to wasted time and resources without contributing to better outcomes. Assess, improve, or eliminate standards or protocols that don't add value but increase the workload. Periodically review standards and protocols, seeking feedback from the ground level. If a standard doesn't add value, consider eliminating or revising it.
- *Create a shared knowledge repository*: A shared knowledge base prevents repeated mistakes, aids training, and reduces the time spent searching for information. Develop a centralized place where all members can access and contribute to collective knowledge. Employ knowledge management tools, regularly update the repository, and incentivize contributions from team members.
- *Invest in Training**: Make a substantial investment in training for the process, tools, and project. It ensures that there's a baseline requirement met before people start contributing to the project. Ensure that teams are trained on the established standards and processes. It enables them to work efficiently and effectively within the defined guidelines. Teams should be trained on those standards and process so that they don't waste effort identifying themselves.

### Optimize processes

By optimizing processes, you can streamline workflows, eliminate unnecessary steps, and reduce manual effort. The increased efficiency can lead to cost savings by reducing the amount of time and resources required to complete tasks. To optimize processes, consider the following recommendations:

- *Refine the software development lifecycle (SDLC) approach*: Adopting an optimal SDLC can achieve high quality with less overhead. Assess your current SDLC method and consider more efficient alternatives. Explore and adopt methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or Waterfall. Periodically reassess chosen frameworks for better efficiency, recognizing that SDLC is inherently collaborative.
- *Optimize per role*: Defined roles ensure clear responsibilities and expectations, leading to increased efficiency. Understand and define the requirements of each role like developers, solution architects. When you want to expand the team, you should know what each role needs in terms of hardware, licenses, access, etc.
- *Streamline change management*: Positive receptiveness to change ensures smoother transitions and better outcomes. Make the process of implementing change smoother and more accepted. Cultivate a culture of active participation over resistance. Promote change adoption using coaching and continuous learning. Adapt to change constructively.

### Optimize operations

Optimizing operations means streamlining tasks to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. By removing redundancies and implementing best practices, you can complete tasks faster and with fewer resources. It not only maximizes output but also frees up time for other value-driven activities.

#### Reduce noise to signal ratio

Distinguishing signal from noise is crucial in observability because it allows teams to focus on the most critical aspects of their systems and applications. By filtering out noise, teams can make informed decisions, troubleshoot problems, and optimize the workload faster. Identifying and addressing issues more efficiently in less time leads to a reduction in personnel costs.

To differentiate signal from noise, you need to define clear objectives and metrics. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are relevant to your workload. Establish thresholds or ranges for each metric to determine what is considered normal behavior and what should be flagged as an anomaly. Utilize monitoring tools to collect data and track the defined metrics in real-time and identify patterns that indicate potential issues or areas of improvement.

You must prioritize actionable insights. Focus on the insights that degrade the workload and prioritize them for further investigation or action. Regularly review and update your monitoring strategy based on feedback.

#### Use high fidelity debugging

High fidelity debugging refers to the ability to accurately diagnose and fix issues in software applications. You gain detailed insights into the application's behavior and state during runtime. High fidelity debugging is crucial for effective software development and troubleshooting. With high fidelity debugging, developers can reproduce and analyze issues with greater precision, reducing the time and effort required to fix bugs. Understanding the application's behavior allows developers to make informed decisions faster to improve code quality.

- *Use a debugging tool*: Utilize a feature-rich debugger that provides comprehensive insights into the application's execution flow, variables, and memory state.
- *Enable detailed logging and tracing*: Instrument the code with logging and tracing statements to capture relevant information during runtime, aiding in issue diagnosis.
- *Analyze error messages and stack traces*: Carefully examine error messages and stack traces to understand the context and sequence of events leading to the issue.

#### Enhance technical support

Reducing recurring issues saves time and improves user satisfaction. Improve the efficiency and efficacy of technical support operations. Identify recurring support issues, integrate engineering and support teams via support shadowing, and adopt IT classic deployment model processes to reduce overall support load.

#### Learn from incidents

Analyzing incidents can prevent recurrences and improve reaction times. Use past incidents as learning opportunities for future improvements. Conduct retrospectives to dissect incidents, identify improved actions and contact protocols, and enhance system observability through comprehensive logs and metrics.

#### Implement robust governance

Standardization reduces errors and rework, ensuring consistent quality and cost optimization. Strengthen compliance and standardization within the organization. Automate compliance checks, advocate for standardized solutions, architectures, and blueprints. Minimize choices that don't align with organizational constraints or SLAs to streamline decision-making.

### Optimize personnel skills

Better skills lead to increased efficiency and fewer mistakes. Invest in the development and improvement of your team's skills. To optimize personnel skills, here are some recommendations to consider:

- *Upskilling*: Ensure team members acquire essential cost optimization and monitoring skills. Provide sandbox environments for hands-on learning and skill development. Encourage obtaining certifications and promote shadowing experienced colleagues.
- *Tools*: Proficiency in using tools is a key skill for optimizing tasks and gaining valuable insights for cost management. Ensure personnel are proficient in using essential tools and can adapt to new ones. Prioritize familiarity with key tools, especially tools related to monitoring. Train personnel to extract meaningful insights from data across various system layers, emphasizing the link between effective monitoring and cost management.
- *Align to expertise*: Match employees to tasks based on their skills and expertise. Utilize their strengths and allocate tasks accordingly to maximize efficiency.
