# How to use the Azure Well-Architected Framework documentation

The Azure Well-Architected Framework provides guiding principles that you can use to enhance the quality of your workloads. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost optimization
- Operational excellence
- Performance efficiency

Well-Architected Framework provides technical guidance that is specifically targeted at the workload level across these five pillars. You can use the Well-Architected Framework documentation library to help you design well-architected and high-quality workloads on Azure.

## Audience

This documentation set is tailored to cloud solution architects who are seeking insights and valuable information to enhance their expertise in the field. As experienced professionals in enterprise architecture, workload architecture, development, or workload management, they are particularly interested in building and managing web applications hosted on Azure.

The content herein is designed to support their continuous efforts in optimizing workloads to create high-quality, stable, and efficient cloud solutions.

## How the Well-Architected Framework can help

Let’s say you’re building a web application that will be hosted on Azure. You want to make sure that the application is reliable, secure, cost-effective, and efficient. Here’s an example of how you might use the Well-Architected Framework to achieve these goals:

- **Reliability:** To make sure that your application is resilient and available, you might use [Azure Availability Zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) so that your application is highly available and can recover from failures.
- **Security:** You want to protect your application and data from threats. To achieve this, you can use [Azure Security Center](/azure/security/) to monitor your application for security threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Cost optimization:** You want to manage costs to maximize the value delivered. [Azure Cost Management and Billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/) helps you monitor your costs and optimize your spending.
- **Operational excellence:** You want to ensure that your operations processes keep your system running in production. To achieve this, you might use [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/) to monitor your application for performance issues and errors.
- **Performance efficiency:** You want to ensure that your application can adapt to changes in load. To achieve this, you might use [Azure Autoscale](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview) to automatically scale your application based on demand.

### Recommendations

Here are some recommendations when using the Well-Architected Framework:

- Understand the [five pillars of architectural excellence](pillars.md). The Well-Architected Framework consists of five pillars: reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency. It’s important to understand the pillars and how they relate to your workload.
- Assess your workload. The [Assessment review tool](pillars.md#assessment-review-tool) is free and can help you assess your workload using the tenets found in the Well-Architected Framework.
- Use [Azure Advisor and Advisor Score](/azure/advisor/azure-advisor-score#introduction-to-advisor-score) to identify and prioritize opportunities to improve the posture of your workloads. Both services are free to all Azure users and align to the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework.
- Incorporate the pillars into your cloud architecture. By incorporating the five pillars into your cloud architecture, you can produce a high quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture.
- Continuously improve your architecture. The Well-Architected Framework is not a one-time exercise but rather an ongoing process of continuous improvement.

## Explore the Well-Architected Framework documentation

Now that you understand the benefits of using Well-Architected Framework in your workload, here is our recommendation for how to use the documentation library as you move forward in your journey of improving and optimizing your workload.

- Begin your journey at the [pillar level](pillars.md). We encourage you to look at all pillars equally. Review each Overview page and see how the pillars relate to each other.
- Drill down into each pillar to discover the design principles for each one. Each design principle has a goal that everyone is trying to achieve.
- Within each principle, we provide some approaches. Follow the approaches to create your well-architected strategy. The approaches aren’t optional; you must consider these.
- Then proceed to the checklist.  You always begin your evaluation path with a checklist. Each checklist item comes out of the assessment tool. And links are provided to a deeper guide with subsections that answer the particular question coming out of the assessment tool.
- From the checklist, you can determine how close you are to being well-architected.

> [!NOTE]
> The design principle approaches aren't checklist items. They're intended to provide guidance for aspects of each pillar that you should consider throughout the development lifecycle. Start with the recommended approaches and justify the benefits for a set of requirements. After you set your strategy, drive actions by using the corresponding checklist.

### What you can expect

Here are just a few of the benefits you can experience after implementing the Well-Architected Framework into your environment:

- You achieve a successful implementation.
- You can be confident that you have been set up for success since these tenets are backed by proven assessments.
- You feel empowered as you move forward with your workload.
- You understand that you might have to make choices when implementing the tenets and you can confidently assess the tradeoffs and risks.
- You have successfully optimized your environment.
