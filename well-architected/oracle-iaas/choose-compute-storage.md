# What is compute and storage?

You can use Azure to migrate Oracle workloads to match on-premises in an infrastructure as a service (Iaas) model. Oracle workload's complexity, size, and high input/output (IO) demands can cause problems in the cloud. Oracle database performance is dependent on several parameters: read/write disk throughput MBps, read/write IOPS, CPU, RAM, and network latency. Choosing the correct combination of compute and storage on Azure Iaas and the placement of application workloads relative to database services is necessary for the migration of Oracle workloads.

This article describes how to right-size compute and storage for your Oracle workload on Azure IaaS for a successful cloud deployment.

## Assess the Oracle workload using AWR reports

In order to get right-sizing recommendations for the required Azure infrastructure, you'll need to generate either an Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) report or Statspack report for each database that you plan to migrate to Azure.

An AWR report is a detailed performance analysis report generated by the Oracle database. It provides comprehensive information about database performance, wait events, system resources, and more. An AWR report is included with the Oracle Database Enterprise Edition - Diagnostic Pack option. However, if you are running the Standard Edition or an Enterprise edition without a Diagnostic Pack license, then you should instead use a Statspack report. For more information, see [AWR report](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/tgdba/download-awr-report.html#GUID-735F06E5-C97A-41B1-8C23-F2FEFDE0CED0).

You should always have insight into the peak load. If the peak load occurs on backup timings during the night and Backup RTO/RPO requirements are inline with 4 hours, then repeat the same exercise for an average load. Note that a peak load usually is a window of 1 hour. You can determine the peak load by using the Oracle Enterprise Manager. If you don't have a license for it or don't use it, you can use the following script that provides you with the [top 5 busiest times](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/blob/main/az-oracle-sizing/busiest_awr.sql). This script is available for [Standard Edition databases](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/blob/main/az-oracle-sizing/busiest_statspack.sql) and [Enterprise Edition databases](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/blob/main/az-oracle-sizing/busiest_awr.sql).

### Recommendations

- Generate comprehensive AWR reports for a database right-sizing exercise.
- Generate the busiest AWR report for peak workload during short periods of time, such as one hour or 30 minutes.
- Generate a peak-load AWR report, or an average-peak load if desired.
- If available, provide any additional AWR reports that might provide important details about the database workload, such as end-of-month or end-of-quarter reporting periods.
- The report should be in HTML format in order to be used by the right-sizing tool.
- If you aren't sure when your peak load happens, you can use the following scripts to provide you with the top 5 busiest times:
  - [AWR](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/blob/main/az-oracle-sizing/busiest_awr.sql)
  - [Statspack](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/blob/main/az-oracle-sizing/busiest_statspack.sql)

## Right-size your Oracle Database

You should carefully analyze an AWR report or Statspack report of your Oracle workloads in order to right-size your Azure infrastructure so that it's capable of meeting the performance requirements.
By right-sizing we're reviewing your workload requirements to match with the right VM SKU under careful consideration of vCPU, memory, throughput, IOPS. Such analyses are based on expert understanding of all aspects of database performance and require automated tools in order to consider all the associated variables. For more information about prerequisites and limitations of automated tools, see [Oracle Migration Assistant Tool (OMAT)](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/tree/main/omat).

When you use the OMAT tool, make sure to review the partition of CPU and Cores. This provides you the Hyper-Threaded factor. Per default the tool uses a factor of "2". Make sure to adjust it based on your specific usage. Additionally, we encourage you to always reach out to your local contact person if you seek expert support.

### Recommendations

- Gain access to automated right-sizing tools. Oracle Migration Assistant Tool [(OMAT)](https://github.com/Azure/Oracle-Workloads-for-Azure/tree/main/omat) helps you understand resource usage on Oracle installations, either on premise or in any cloud, and recommends the most suitable Virtual Machine (VM) and storage that can run the same workload on Azure. OMAT works by processing AWR reports collected from the source system. Required data is extracted from AWR files and placed into an Excel workbook.
- OMAT automates steps defined in the AWR sizing document to speed up the process and simplifies the complexities in the AWR report.
- Seek experts with the skills to understand the implications of the recommendations generated by OMAT.

## Choose the right VM for your Workload

The OMAT tool provides the optimal sizing recommendations for Oracle on Azure IaaS. You then have to make a decision on choosing one of the OMAT recommendations to implement your workload on Azure.
Make sure that you chose a VM, which is Hyper-Threaded enabled in order to gain license-savings where applicable.

### Recommendations

- The [E-series](/azure/virtual-machines/edv5-edsv5-series) and [M-series](/azure/virtual-machines/m-series) VMs are the common choices for your database. The E-series can handle high throughput values, while the M-series should be used when your workload requires high memory. Both are hyper-threaded enabled.
- Each VM family comes with a selection of sizes and can be matched to your needs. Microsoft also offers so called [constrained core sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/constrained-vcpu?tabs=family-E). Constrained core sizes provide the same machine but with fewer cores to optimize Oracle licensing.
- Apply the Azure Pricing tools to compare the cost of the different Azure VM recommendations.
- Use Azure Reservations to reduce compute infrastructure costs.

## Storage considerations for Oracle on Azure IaaS

Choosing the right Azure storage for the database is determined by many factors, including the database size, IOPS, and throughput. Azure Storage provides a wide range of storage options, and Azure Premium Managed Disks provides excellent capabilities for Oracle workloads. The right-sizing assessment determines if the database requires a more permanent storage solution.

Other storage considerations are related to data files archived redo logs and backups. Archiving redo logs is typically an ongoing read/write operation. These logs need to be evaluated based on the solution requirements and availability.

Customers with on-premises systems usually have the following disk layout. The AWR report provides great insight into the throughput and IOPS requirements of your specific workload. It's crucial to know your throughput and IOPS requirements before deployment because Oracle workloads are performance sensitive.

The following table provides an example of a data disk storage-layout:

| Disk name  |  Function | Size (GB) |Throughput |  IOPS | Disk recommendation  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| oredo  | Online Redo Logs  | 400  |  150 |  1500 | Wherever available, choose Premium SSD v2, otherwise P20 |
| oarch  | Archive Redo Logs  | 7000  | 300  |  1250 | Azure Blob Storage configured in Hot Tier |
| odata  | Data files and control files   |  18000 | 1000  | 2500 | Choose Premium SSD v2 when available and 5*P50 (striped to RAID-0) otherwise|

The temporary tablespace can consume a lot of throughput and IOPS. If this is the case for your specific workload, you should choose a VM that has an attached ephemeral disk, such as [Ed-v5](/azure/virtual-machines/edv5-edsv5-series), and put the temporary tablespace onto it. You can also choose other disk types depending on your requirements.

Note that this is only an example of one customer workload. Make sure to always review the requirements of the size of your workload, the IOPS and throughput accordingly.

If you need to use multiple disks for one or more logical volumes in your disk setup, regardless of the disk technology you choose (Oracle ASM or LVM or other), make sure that you balance the load across disks for maximum performance.

You can make use of Premium SSD v2 managed disks wherever they're available. Check availability in accordance with the region before deployment. Also review [disk configurations](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-design#disk-types-and-configurations).

If you use Oracle ASM and Managed Disks, the default configured disk size in ASM is decisive. This means if you configured ASM for a maximum size of 4096 GB, ASM can only process this amount. It results in that even if you provision higher disks, ASM wouldn't recognize the space. Plan for disk size accordingly and whether to provision a certain number of 4095 GB disks. For more information, see [ASM configuration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ostmg/create-diskgroups.html#GUID-7FB8914B-0995-4DA0-8F37-15B8EEAEEE4D).

### Recommendations

- Use the recommendations generated by the OMAT tool to guide you through your database storage options.
- Understand the different Azure disk types and how they fit into your workload requirements by studying [Disk types](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types).
- Review best practices for disk configuration in [Disk types and configurations](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-design#disk-types-and-configurations).
- If you would like to consider Azure Netapp Files as your storage layer, then you can find further information in [Azure Netapp Files for Oracle](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/file-storage/oracle-azure-netapp-files).
- In case you are decoupling from an Exadata, you might also want to have a look at [Application Volume Groups](/azure/azure-netapp-files/performance-oracle-multiple-volumes).
- Suitable options for Redo Log archives are [Azure Files (hot tier)](/azure/storage/files/understand-performance#choosing-a-performance-tier-based-on-usage-patterns), especially for large volumes, and Azure Premium Managed disks.
- The Backup option for Oracle workloads should be based on the data volume and your technical and non-technical requirements.
- The following provides an overview of [Backup strategies for Oracle workloads](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-strategies).
- Plan your storage layout to avoid performance impact.

## Size the necessary compute infrastructure for Oracle applications

Oracle applications can typically be moved to Azure using VMs with similar capabilities as those used in the on-premise deployment.

### Recommendations

- It's important to have available data points from the web tier and the application tier. These include:

  - Number of vCPUs
  - Average usage of vCPU
  - Memory size
  - Average memory usage
  - App storage size
  - App version
  - Operating system
  - Total IOPS
  - Total throughput
  - Backup strategy

The application tier can be moved to any suitable VM SKU that meets the performance and cost optimization requirements.
