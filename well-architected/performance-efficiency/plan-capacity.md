# Recommendations for capacity planning: PE 02

This guide describes the best practices for capacity planning. You should perform formal capacity planning at key points in the lifecycle of the workload. Capacity planning enables you to anticipate short and long-term demand and manage workload performance effectively. By analyzing historical usage patterns and growth trends, you can identify potential bottlenecks, scalability challenges, or performance constraints.

## Key design strategy

Capacity planning is a predictive exercise. It's about making informed decisions based on load predictions and workload behavior. The objective is to ensure efficient workload performance, not just when demand grows or shrinks, but by recognizing the nuances of continuous load versus peak load events.

### Understand the workload

Before you can predict the capacity requirements of a workload, you need to understand the workload. To do this, you need to gather information about the workload and its characteristics. The information gathering includes understanding the purpose, requirements, and behavior of the workload. You should do this for an existing workload with historical data or a new workload in the design phase.

**Understand an existing workload.** Gather the historical data related to the workload for which capacity planning is being done. This can include metrics like resource utilization, performance data, workload patterns, and any other relevant data points.

- *Understand the data:* Review the available historical data and understand its structure, format, and relevance to capacity planning. This could include data such as resource utilization metrics, workload patterns, performance metrics, and any other relevant data points.
- *Clean and preprocess the data:* Prepare the data for analysis by removing any inconsistencies, errors, or outliers. This might involve data cleaning techniques like data imputation, handling missing values, or normalization.
*Identify key metrics:* Identify the metrics that are relevant for capacity planning. This could include metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, network throughput, and response times.
*Visualize the data:* Create visualizations, such as charts or plots, to gain better insights into the historical data. Visualizations can help identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, providing a clearer understanding of the workload behavior.

**Understand a new workload.** When it comes to new workloads without historical data, predicting the future needs of a workload can be more challenging. In such cases, you should consider alternative approaches such as:

- *Market research:* Conducting market research to understand the demand for similar products or services can provide valuable insights into potential demand for the new workload. This can involve analyzing market trends, conducting surveys, or studying competitor offerings.
- *Expert judgment:* Seeking input from subject matter experts or professionals with experience in the industry can help in estimating the demand for a new workload. Their expertise and insights can provide valuable inputs for forecasting.
- *Pilot projects or prototypes:* Launching small-scale pilot projects or prototypes can help gather real-time data and feedback. This data can then be used to inform the capacity planning process and adjust the forecasted demand.
- *External data sources:* Leveraging external data sources such as industry reports, market studies, or customer surveys can provide additional information for estimating demand for new workloads. These sources can offer valuable insights into customer preferences, market trends, and potential demand drivers.

### Forecast future demand

Forecasting future demand involves analyzing historical data and using various techniques to predict future patterns. Using this historical data, you can apply statistical analysis, trend analysis, or predictive modeling techniques to forecast future demand. These methods take into account the historical patterns and project them into the future, providing estimates of the expected workload demand.

**Account for different scenarios.** When you do capacity planning, you need to plan for different scenarios that might occur. This planning should include both predictable growth patterns and unexpected surges in demand. Usage patterns can grow or shrink. They can be organic (more or less users) or inorganic (event or security incident). You need to conduct capacity planning before usage changes, including the following examples:

- Design (prediction)
- Regular spikes (8am sign-on rush)
- Launch (prediction validation)
- Business model change
- Acquisition or merger
- Marketing push
- Seasonal change
- Feature launch
- Periodically

**Use prediction techniques.** Forecasting future demand for a service or product involves utilizing various techniques such as statistical analysis, trend analysis, and predictive modeling. Here's an overview of how you can use these techniques:

- *Statistical analysis:* Statistical methods can help uncover patterns and relationships within historical data, which you can use to forecast future demand. You can use techniques such as time series analysis, regression analysis, and moving averages to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data.
- *Trend analysis:* Trend analysis involves examining historical data to identify consistent patterns and extrapolating those patterns into the future. For example, if workload demand has increased by 10% over the past year, then you might forecast a continuation of this trend. By analyzing historical demand data over a period of time, organizations can identify growth or decline trends and use them as a basis for forecasting future demand. Trend analysis can also identify the effects of one-time events that cause rapid shifts in traffic up or down (inorganic). For example, feature releases might consistently increase demand by 5%. If you have four major releases a year, you should plan for 5% growth each time.
- *Predictive modeling:* Predictive modeling involves building mathematical models that use historical data and other relevant variables to make predictions about future demand. This can include techniques such as machine learning algorithms, neural networks, or decision trees. These models can take into account multiple factors and variables to provide more accurate forecasts.

### Determine resource requirements

Based on the forecasted demand, calculate the resources needed to meet that demand. This includes considering factors such as server capacity, network bandwidth, storage capacity, and human resources.

**Identify reachable limits.** Capacity planning should find hard limits in the workload and evaluate if those are in reach. These limits usually apply to infrastructure (compute, memory, storage, network), application (concurrent database connections, response times, availability), service (requests per second), and scaling. When capacity planning identifies reachable limits, you need to modify the workload before the limit becomes a performance issue. Performance baseline, continuous monitoring, and testing are essential to validating the limits and the fix.

**Understand functional requirements.** Workload requirements include functional and technical requirements. You should meet with stakeholders to ensure you understand the functional requirements of the workload. The technical requirements should support the functional requirements. You need to understand the workload architecture so you can identify the correct components to modify.

**Understand resource limitations.** Resources in your workload have performance limitations. Performance limitations apply to services and SKUs within each service. You need to understand the limitations of the resources in your workload and should factor those limitations into your design decisions. For example, you should know if resources limitations require changing SKUs or changing resources altogether.

### Optimize resource allocation

Evaluate different scenarios and strategies to optimize resource allocation. This may involve adjusting resource capacity, implementing load balancing techniques, or leveraging cloud services for scalability.

- *Adjust resource capacity*: Evaluate the current resource capacity and adjust it based on the workload demands. This can involve scaling up or down the available resources to match the workload requirements. For example, if the workload experiences higher demand during certain periods, consider increasing the resource capacity during those times.
- *Implement load balancing techniques*: Distribute the workload across multiple resources or instances to ensure efficient utilization of resources. Load balancing can help prevent overloading specific resources and optimize performance by evenly distributing the workload.
- *Leverage cloud services for scalability*: Take advantage of cloud services that offer elasticity and scalability, allowing resources to automatically adjust based on demand. Cloud services like auto-scaling can dynamically allocate resources based on workload needs, ensuring optimal resource utilization and minimizing costs.

**Test conclusions.** Capacity planning is an iterative process. You should test the conclusions of your capacity planning and adjust the estimates accordingly.

## Azure facilitation

Azure Monitor provides tools to establish performance targets, conduct trend analysis, and perform capacity planning.

## Tradeoff

Misjudged capacity planning could lead to over provisioning or under provisioning resources. Over provisioning could increase the attack surface and cost of the workload unnecessarily. Under provisioning would degrade performance and reliability.
