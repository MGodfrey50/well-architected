# Azure Well-Architected Framework review - Log Analytics
This article provides architectural best practices for [Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview) in [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview). The guidance is based on the five pillars of architecture excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost optimization
- Operational excellence
- Performance efficiency

This article assumes that you understand system design principles and have a working knowledge of Log Analytics workspaces and features in Azure Monitor that populate it with data. For more information, see [Log Analytics workspace overview](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview).

## Prerequisites
Understanding the Well-Architected Framework pillars can help produce a high-quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture. We recommend that you review your workload by using the [Azure Well-Architected Framework Review](/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review&mode=pre-assessment) assessment.

 In order to maintain their functionality and performance, workloads need to be monitored in diverse ways and for diverse reasons. Log Analytics workspaces are a common sink for a significant portion of that monitoring data and support multiple features in Azure Monitor including ad-hoc queries, visualizations, and alerts. Start with [Monitoring and diagnostics guidance](/azure/architecture/best-practices/monitoring) which presents general monitoring principles and identifies the different types of data and required analysis supported by Azure Monitor and enabled by data stored in the workspace.

## Reliability
[Reliability](../reliability/index.yml) refers a workload's resiliency to malfunction and its ability to return to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether in the cloud, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component.

As Log Analytics workspace is a regional resource, the primary reliability situation to consider is the availability of the workspace and protection of collected data in the case of failure of an Azure datacenter or region. There's currently no standard feature for failover between workspaces in different regions, but there are strategies that you can use if you have particular requirements for availability or compliance.

The reliability situations to consider for Log Analytics workspaces are availability of the workspace and protection of collected data in the rare case of failure of an Azure datacenter or region. There's currently no standard feature for failover between workspaces in different regions, but there are strategies that you can use if you have particular requirements for availability or compliance.


### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Review [service limits for Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#log-analytics-workspaces)** to understand restrictions on data collection and retention, and other aspects of the service. These limits will help you determine how to properly design your workload observability strategy.  Be sure to review [Azure Monitor service limits](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits) as well as many of the functions discussed therein work hand-in-hand with Log Analytics workspaces, like queries. 
> - **Plan for workspace resilience and recovery.** Log Analytics workspaces are regional, with no built-in support for cross-regional redundancy or replication. As such, you should determine the reliability requirements of your workspaces and strategize to meet those targets. Your requirements may stipulate that your workspace must be resilient to datacenter failures or regional failures, or they may stipulate that you must be able to recover your data to a new workspace in a failover region. Each of these scenarios require additional resources and processes to be put in place to be successful, so balancing your reliability targets with cost and complexity should be carefully considered. 
> - **Choose the right deployment regions to meet your reliability requirements.** Deploy your Log Analytics workspace and data collection endpoints (DCEs) close to your workload. Your choice of the appropriate region to deploy your workspace and your DCEs in should be informed by your decision-making about where to [deploy your workload](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/regions).  You may need to weigh the availability of certain services, like dedicated clusters, against other factors more central to your workload’s performance and cost requirements. 
> - **Determine your log ingestion and retention requirements.** Ingesting, storing and processing logs in the cloud has cost implications, so being aware of the amount of data that is being sent to your workspaces is important to be able to predict costs and look for optimization opportunities. Likewise, be thoughtful about your log retention policies to ensure that any compliance requirements are met while not being wasteful. 
> - **Ensure that your observability systems are healthy.**  Like any other component of your workload, you need to be able to ensure that your monitoring and logging systems are functioning properly. To accomplish this, enable features that send health data to your operations teams specifically about your Log Analytics workspaces and associated services.  
 
### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| Do not include your Log Analytics workspaces in your [workload’s critical path](/azure/well-architected/reliability/identify-flows). Your workspaces are important to a functioning observability system, but the functionality of your workload must not depend on them. | Keeping your workspaces and associated functions out of your workload’s critical path minimizes the risk of issues affecting your observability system from affecting your workload. |
| To support the durability of workspace data, Log Analytics workspaces should be deployed into a [region](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/availability-zones#data-resilience---supported-regions) that supports data resilience. Data resilience is only possible through linking of the workspace to a [dedicated cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters?tabs=azure-portal) in the same region. | Using a dedicated cluster allows you to spread the associated workspaces across availability zones, which offers protection against datacenter outages. If you don't collect enough data now to justify a dedicated cluster, this preemptive regional choice will support future growth. |
| Choose your workspace deployment based on proximity to your workload.<br><br> Use data collection endpoints (DCE) in the same region as the Log Analytics workspace. | Deploy your primary workspace in the same region as the primary instances of your workload.  Having your workspace and DCEs in the same region as your workload mitigates the risk of being impacted by outages in other regions.<br><br> DCEs are used by the Azure Monitor agent and the Logs ingestion API to send data to a Log Analytics workspace. You may need multiple DCEs even though your deployment only has a single workspace. See [How to set up data collection endpoints based on your deployment](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview#how-to-set-up-data-collection-endpoints-based-on-your-deployment) for details on how to configure DCEs for your particular environment.<br><br> If your workload is deployed in an active-active design, consider the use of multiple workspaces and DCEs spread across the regions your workload is deployed in.<br><br> Deploying workspaces in multiple regions adds complexity to your environment. Balance the criteria detailed in [Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) with your availability requirements. |
| If you require the **workspace to be available** in the case of a region failure, or you don't collect enough data for a dedicated cluster, configure data collection to send critical data to multiple workspaces in different regions, also known as multicasting. | Configure your data sources to send to multiple workspaces in different regions. For example, configure DCRs for multiple workspaces for Azure Monitor agent running on virtual machines, and multiple diagnostic settings to collection resource logs from Azure resources, configured to send the logs to each workspace, as appropriate. <br><br>Even though the data will be available in the alternate workspace in case of failure, resources that rely on the data such as alerts and workbooks wouldn't know to use this workspace. Consider storing ARM templates for critical resources with configuration for the alternate workspace in Azure DevOps or as disabled [policies](/azure/governance/policy/overview) that can quickly be enabled in a failover scenario.<br><br> Tradeoff: This configuration results in duplicate ingestion and retention charges so only use it for critical data. |
| If you require **data to be protected** in the case of datacenter or region failure, configure data export from the workspace to save data in an alternate location.<br><br> This option is similar to the previous option of multicasting the data to different workspaces, but has a lower cost because the extra data is written to storage.<br><br> Data export is susceptible to regional incidents because it relies on the stability of the Azure Monitor ingestion pipeline in your region. It doesn't provide resiliency against incidents impacting the regional ingestion pipeline. | The [data export feature of Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export) allows you to continuously export data sent to specific tables to Azure storage where it can be retained for extended periods. Use [Azure Storage redundancy options](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#redundancy-in-a-secondary-region), including GRS and GZRS, to replicate this data to other regions. If you require export of [tables that aren't supported by data export](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal#limitations), you can use other methods of exporting data, including Logic apps, to protect your data.<br><br> In order for this strategy to work as a viable recovery plan, you must plan to have processes in place to reconfigure diagnostic settings for your resources in Azure as well as on all agents that provide telemetry, and to manually rehydrate your exported data into a new workspace. As with the above option, you will also need to define processes for those resources that rely on the data like alerts and workbooks. |
| For mission-critical workloads requiring high availability, consider implementing a federated workspace model that uses multiple workspaces to provide high availability in the case of regional failure. | [Mission-critical](/azure/well-architected/mission-critical/mission-critical-overview) provides prescriptive best practice guidance for architecting highly reliable applications on Azure. The design methodology includes a federated workspace model with multiple Log Analytics workspaces to deliver [high availability](/azure/well-architected/mission-critical/mission-critical-design-methodology#select-a-reliability-tier) in the case of multiple failures, including the failure of an Azure region.<br><br> This strategy eliminates egress costs across regions and remains operational with a region failure, but it requires additional complexity that you must manage with configuration and processes described in [Health modeling and observability of mission-critical workloads on Azure](/azure/well-architected/mission-critical/mission-critical-health-modeling).|
| Use Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to deploy and manage your workspaces and associated functions.<br><br> Minimize transformation in data collection rules (DCRs). | Automating as much of your deployment and your mechanisms for resilience and recovery as practical will ensure that these operations are reliable. You will save critical time in your operations processes and minimize the risk of human error.<br><br> Ensure that functions like saved log queries are also defined through your IaC to recover them to a new region if recovery is required.<br><br> While transformation can be powerful and necessary in some situations, it can be challenging to test and troubleshoot the KQL work being done. When possible, minimize risk of data loss by ingesting the data raw and handling transformations downstream at query time. |
| Design DCRs with a single responsibility principle to keep DCR rules simple. | While one DCR could be loaded with all the input, rules, and destinations for the source systems, it's preferable to design narrowly focused rules that rely on fewer data sources. Use composition of rule assignments to arrive at the desired observability scope for the logical target.<br><br> This strategy minimizes the risk of a misconfiguration of a rule having broad impact by limiting impact only to the scope for which the DCR was built. See [Best practices for data collection rule creation and management in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-best-practices). |
| When setting a [daily cap](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap) or a retention policy, ensure that you are maintaining your reliability requirements by ingesting and retaining the logs that you need. | A daily cap stops the collection of data for a workspace once a given amount has been reached, which helps you maintain control over your ingestion volume. However, using this feature should only be done after careful planning. Ensure that your daily cap is not being hit with regularity. If this scenario happens, it means that your cap is set too restrictively and needs to be reconfigured, so that you don’t miss critical signals coming from your workload.<br><br> Likewise, any lowering of your data retention policy should be carefully and thoughtfully approached to ensure that you do not inadvertently lose critical data. |
| Monitor the health of your Log Analytics workspaces. | Use [Log Analytics workspace insights](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) to track ingestion volume, ingested data vs your data cap, unresponsive log sources, and failed queries among other data. Create [health status alert](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-health#view-log-analytics-workspace-health-and-set-up-health-status-alerts) to proactively notify you if a workspace becomes unavailable because of a datacenter or regional failure. |

### Azure Policy

Azure offers no policies related to reliability of Log Analytics workspaces. [Custom policies](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition) can be created to build compliance guardrails around your workspace deployments, such as ensuring workspaces are associated to a dedicated cluster.

While not directly related to the reliability of Log Analytics workspaces themselves, there are Azure policies for nearly every service available to ensure that diagnostics settings are enabled for that service; validating that the service's log data is flowing into a Log Analytics workspace. All services in workload architecture should be sending their log data to a Log Analytics workspace for their own reliability needs, and these policies can help enforce this. Likewise, policies exist to ensure agent-based platforms, such as virtual machines and Kubernetes, have the agent installed.

### Azure Advisor

Azure offers no Azure Advisor recommendations related to the reliability of Log Analytics workspaces.


## Security

[Security](../security/index.yml) is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. Azure Monitor provides features to employ both the principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth. Use the following information to maximize the security of your Log Analytics workspaces and ensure that only authorized clients can insert data and only authorized users access that collected data.

### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Review the Azure Monitor [security baseline](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-monitor-security-baseline)** and [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access) articles for guidance on security best practices. 
> - **Deploy your workspaces with segmentation as a cornerstone principle.** Segmentation should be implemented at the networking, data, and access levels to ensure that your workspaces are isolated to the appropriate degree and are protected from unauthorized access to the highest degree possible, while still meeting your business requirements for reliability, cost optimization, performance efficiency and operational excellence.
> - **Ensure that you can audit workspace activities and associated identities.** Enable auditing of queries run from the Azure Portal or through API interactions, and the associated users. If you are not set up to audit your workspace, you are putting your organization at risk of being in breach of compliance requirements, and you may not catch log injection attacks.
> - **Implement robust network controls.** Secure your network access to your workspace and your logs through network isolation and firewall functions. Insufficiently configured network controls may put you at risk of being accessed by unauthorized or malicious actors.
> - **Determine what types of data need immutability or long-term retention.** Your log data should be treated with the same rigor as data inside production systems. Include log data in your data classification practices to ensure that you are successfully storing sensitive log data according to its compliance requirements.
> - **Protect log data at rest through encryption.** Segmentation alone will not completely protect your log data. If unauthorized access is achieved, having the log data encrypted at rest will prevent bad actors from using that data outside of your workspace
> - **Protect sensitive log data through obfuscation.** Just like data residing in production systems, you must take extra measures to ensure that sensitive information is protected. Using obfuscation methods will help you hide sensitive log data from unauthorized eyes.

### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| (Control plane) Secure your workspace through private networking and segmentation measures. |Use [private link](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/private-link-security) functionality to limit communications between log sources and your workspaces to private networking.<br><br> Using private link also allows you control which VNets can access a given workspace, further bolstering your security through segmentation. |
| (Control Plane) Use customer managed keys if you require your own encryption key to protect data and saved queries in your workspaces. | Azure Monitor ensures that all data and saved queries are encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys (MMK). If you require your own encryption key and collect enough data for a [dedicated cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters), use [customer-managed key](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/customer-managed-keys) for greater flexibility and key lifecycle control. If you use Microsoft Sentinel, then make sure that you're familiar with the considerations at [Set up Microsoft Sentinel customer-managed key](/azure/sentinel/customer-managed-keys#considerations).  |
| (Control Plane) Configure log query auditing to track which users are running queries. | [Log query auditing](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/query-audit) records the details for each query that's run in a workspace. Treat this audit data as security data and secure the [LAQueryLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/laquerylogs) table appropriately. Configure the audit logs for each workspace to be sent to the local workspace, or consolidate in a dedicated security workspace if you separate your operational and security data. Use [Log Analytics workspace insights](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-insights-overview) to periodically review this data and consider creating log query alert rules to proactively notify you if unauthorized users are attempting to run queries. |
| (Control Plane) Use Entra ID instead of API key for API access, such as Query API. | [API key-based access](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview#api-key-authentication-for-sample-data) to the Query APIs does not leave a per-client audit trail. Use sufficiently scoped [Entra ID-based access](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview#microsoft-entra-authentication-for-workspace-data) so that programmatic query access can be properly audited. |
| (Data) Configure access for different types of data in the workspace required for different roles in your organization. | Set the [access control mode](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#access-control-mode) for the workspace to *Use resource or workspace permissions* to allow resource owners to use [resource-context](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#access-mode) to access their data without being granted explicit access to the workspace. This simplifies your workspace configuration and helps to ensure users will not be able to access data they shouldn't.<br><br>Assign the appropriate [built-in role](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#azure-rbac) to grant workspace permissions to administrators at either the subscription, resource group, or workspace level depending on their scope of responsibilities.<br><br>Leverage [table level RBAC](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access#set-table-level-read-access) for users who require access to a set of tables across multiple resources. Users with table permissions have access to all the data in the table regardless of their resource permissions.<br><br>See [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access) for details on the different options for granting access to data in the workspace. |
| (Data) Export audit data for long term retention or immutability. | You may have collected audit data in your workspace that's subject to regulations requiring its long term retention. Data in a Log Analytics workspace can't be altered, but it can be [purged](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/personal-data-mgmt#exporting-and-deleting-personal-data). Use [data export](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export) to send data to an Azure storage account with [immutability policies](/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-policy-configure-version-scope) to protect against data tampering. Not every type of log has the same relevance for compliance, auditing, or security, so determine the specific data types that should be exported. |
| (Data) Implement double encryption for the workspace. | [Double encryption](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption#doubly-encrypt-data-with-infrastructure-encryption) provides an extra layer of encryption to protect against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys may be compromised. This feature requires a [dedicated cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters) which has a daily minimum ingestion limit.  |
| (Data) Determine a strategy to filter or obfuscate sensitive data in your workspace. | You may be collecting data that includes [sensitive information](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/personal-data-mgmt). Filter records that shouldn't be collected using the configuration for the particular data source. Use a [transformation](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-transformations) if only particular columns in the data should be removed or obfuscated.<br><br>If you have standards that require the original data to be unmodified, then you can use the ['h' literal](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/string#obfuscated-string-literals) in KQL queries to obfuscate query results displayed in workbooks. |

### Azure Policy
Azure offers some policies related to the security of Log Analytics workspaces to help enforce your desired security posture. Examples of such policies are:
- [Azure Monitor Logs clusters should be encrypted with customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1f68a601-6e6d-4e42-babf-3f643a047ea2)
- [Azure Monitor Logs clusters should be created with infrastructure-encryption enabled (double encryption)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fea0dfaed-95fb-448c-934e-d6e713ce393d)
- [Saved-queries in Azure Monitor should be saved in customer storage account for logs encryption](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ffa298e57-9444-42ba-bf04-86e8470e32c7)
- [Log Analytics Workspaces should block non-Azure Active Directory based ingestion](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F94c1f94d-33b0-4062-bd04-1cdc3e7eece2)

Azure also offers numerous policies to help enforce private link configuration, such as [Log Analytics workspaces should block log ingestion and querying from public networks](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F6c53d030-cc64-46f0-906d-2bc061cd1334) or even configuring the solution through DINE policies such as [Configure Azure Monitor Private Link Scope to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F437914ee-c176-4fff-8986-7e05eb971365).

### Azure Advisor
Azure offers no Azure Advisor recommendations related to the security of Log Analytics workspaces.

## Cost optimization

[Cost optimization](../cost-optimization/index.yml) refers to ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies in your workload. You can significantly reduce your cost for Azure Monitor by understanding your different configuration options and opportunities to reduce the amount of data that it collects. See [Azure Monitor Logs cost calculations and options](/azure/azure-monitor/cost-usage) to understand how data charges are calculated for your Log Analytics workspaces.


### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Perform cost modeling exercises** to understand your current workspace costs and forecast your costs relative to workspace growth.  Analyze your growth trends and ensure that you understand plans for workload expansion to properly forecast your future costs.
> - **Choose the right billing model.** Use your cost model to determine the best billing model (/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs) for your scenario. How you use your workspaces currently, and how you plan to you use them as your workload evolves will determine whether a pay-as-you-go or a commitment tier model is the best fit for your scenario.<br><br> Remember that you can choose different billing models for each workspace, and you can combine workspace costs in certain cases, so you can be granular in your analysis and decision-making.
> - **Collect just the right amount of log data.** Perform regularly scheduled analysis of your diagnostic settings on your resources to ensure that you aren’t collecting unnecessary log data. Make sure that you are only capturing the required categories for each resource.
> - **Treat nonproduction environments differently than production.** Review your nonproduction environments to ensure that you have configured your diagnostic settings and retention policies appropriately. These can often be significantly less robust than production, especially for dev/test or sandbox environments.

### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| Determine whether to combine your operational data and your security data in the same Log Analytics workspace. | Since all data in a Log Analytics workspace is subject to Microsoft Sentinel pricing if Sentinel is enabled, there may be cost implications to combining this data. See [Design a Log Analytics workspace strategy](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) for details on making this decision for your environment balancing it with criteria in other pillars. |
| Configure pricing tier for the amount of data that each Log Analytics workspace typically collects. | By default, Log Analytics workspaces will use pay-as-you-go pricing with no minimum data volume. If you collect enough data, you can significantly decrease your cost by using a [commitment tier](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs#commitment-tiers), which allows you to commit to a daily minimum of data collected in exchange for a lower rate. If you collect enough data across workspaces in a single region, you can link them to a [dedicated cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-dedicated-clusters) and combine their collected volume using [cluster pricing](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs#dedicated-clusters).<br><br>See [Azure Monitor Logs cost calculations and options](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs) for details on commitment tiers and guidance on determining which is most appropriate for your level of usage. See [Usage and estimated costs](/azure/azure-monitor/usage-estimated-costs#usage-and-estimated-costs) to view estimated costs for your usage at different pricing tiers.  |
| Configure data retention and archiving. | There is a charge for retaining data in a Log Analytics workspace beyond the default of 31 days (90 days if Sentinel is enabled on the workspace and 90 days for Application insights data). Consider your particular requirements for having data readily available for log queries. You can significantly reduce your cost by configuring [Archived Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-retention-archive), which allows you to retain data for up to seven years and still access it occasionally using [search jobs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/search-jobs) or [restoring a set of data](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/restore) to the workspace. |
| Configure tables used for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing as Basic Logs. | Tables in a Log Analytics workspace configured for [Basic Logs](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/basic-logs-configure) have a lower ingestion cost in exchange for limited features and a charge for log queries. If you query these tables infrequently and don't use them for alerting, this query cost can be more than offset by the reduced ingestion cost. |
| Limit data collection from data sources for the workspace. | The primary factor for the cost of Azure Monitor is the amount of data that you collect in your Log Analytics workspace, so you should ensure that you collect no more data that you require to assess the health and performance of your services and applications. See [Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) for details on making this decision for your environment balancing it with criteria in other pillars.<br><br>Tradeoff: There may be a tradeoff between cost and your monitoring requirements. For example, you may be able to detect a performance issue more quickly with a high sample rate, but you may want a lower sample rate to save costs. Most environments will have multiple data sources with different types of collection, so you need to balance your particular requirements with your cost targets for each. See [Cost optimization in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost) for recommendations on configuring collection for different data sources. |
| Regularly analyze collected data to identify trends and anomalies.  | Use [Log Analytics workspace insights](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-insights-overview) to periodically review the amount of data collected in your workspace. In addition to helping you understand the amount of data collected by different sources, it will identify anomalies and upward trends in data collection that could result in excess cost. Further analyze data collection using methods in [Analyze usage in Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/analyze-usage) to determine if there's additional configuration that can decrease your usage further. This is particularly important when you add a new set of data sources, such as a new set of virtual machines or onboard a new service. |
| Create an alert when data collection is high. | To avoid unexpected bills, you should be [proactively notified anytime you experience excessive usage](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/analyze-usage#send-alert-when-data-collection-is-high). Notification allows you to address any potential anomalies before the end of your billing period. |
| Consider a daily cap as a preventative measure to ensure that you don't exceed a particular budget. | A [daily cap](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap) disables data collection in a Log Analytics workspace for the rest of the day after your configured limit is reached. This shouldn't be used as a method to reduce costs as described in [When to use a daily cap](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap#when-to-use-a-daily-cap).<br><br>If you do set a daily cap, in addition to [creating an alert when the cap is reached](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-health#view-log-analytics-workspace-health-and-set-up-health-status-alerts), ensure that you also [create an alert rule to be notified when some percentage has been reached (90% for example)](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/analyze-usage#send-alert-when-data-collection-is-high). This gives you an opportunity to investigate and address the cause of the increased data before the cap shuts off data collection. |

### Azure Policy
Azure offers no policies related to cost optimization of Log Analytics workspaces. [Custom policies](/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-custom-policy-definition) can be created to build compliance guardrails around your workspace deployments, such as ensuring workspaces have desired retention settings.

### Azure Advisor
Azure Advisor will make recommendations to move specific tables in a workspace to the low-cost Basic log data plan for tables that receive relatively high ingestion volume. Understand the limitations using Basic logs before switching. See, [When should I use Basic logs?](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/basic-logs-configure?tabs=portal-1#when-should-i-use-basic-logs)
Azure Advisor will also recommend [changing pricing commitment tier](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/change-pricing-tier) for the whole workspace based on overall usage volume.

## Operational excellence
[Operational excellence](../operational-excellence/index.yml) refers to ensuring workload quality through standardized processes and team cohesion, defining operational procedures for development practices, observability, and release management. Use the following information to minimize the operational toil for Log Analytics workspaces in your workload.

### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Ensure that operations staff is trained on Kusto Query Language (KQL)** and can create or modify queries when needed. If operators are unable to write or modify queries, it can slow down critical troubleshooting or other functions as they will have to rely on other teams to do that work for them.
> - **Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for all of your functions related to your Log Analytics workspaces.**  Minimize the risk of human error that can occur with manually administering and operating your log collection, ingestion, storage and querying functions, including saved queries and query packs, by automating as many of those functions as possible through code. In addition, include alerts that have been created to report health status changes and the configuration of diagnostic settings for resources that will be sending logs to your workspaces in your IaC code. Include this code with your other workload-related code to ensure that your safe deployment practices are maintained for the management of your workspaces. .
> - **Ensure that your workspaces are healthy, and you are notified when issues arise.** Like any other component of your workload, your workspaces can encounter issues that can cost valuable time and resources to troubleshoot and resolve. Being able to proactively monitor workspaces and mitigate potential issues will help your operations teams minimize the time they spend troubleshooting and fixing issues.
> - **Separate your production from nonproduction workloads.** Avoid unnecessary complexity that can cause extra work for operations team by using different workspaces for your production environment than those used by nonproduction environments.  
> - **Prefer built-in tools and functions over third-party solutions** to extend the functionality of your monitoring and logging systems. You may need to put additional configurations in place to support requirements like recoverability or data sovereignty that are not available out-of-the-box with Log Analytics workspaces. In these cases, whenever practical using native Azure or Microsoft tools will allow you to keep the number of tools that your organization must support to a minimum.
> - **Treat your workspaces as immutable infrastructure.** Like other types of data stores, workspaces should not be considered among the ephemeral components of your workload. The Well-Architected Framework generally favors mutable infrastructure and the ability to quickly and easily replace resources within your workload as part of your deployments, but the loss of workspace data can be catastrophic and irreversible. For this reason, leave workspaces out of deployment packages that replace infrastructure during updates. 

### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| Design a workspace strategy to meet your business requirements. | See [Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) for guidance on designing a strategy for your Log Analytics workspaces including how many to create and where to place them.<br><br>A single or at least minimal number of workspaces will maximize your operational efficiency since it limits the distribution of your operational and security data, increasing your visibility into potential issues, making patterns easier to identify, and minimizing your maintenance requirements.<br><br>You may have requirements for multiple workspaces such as multiple tenants, or you may need workspaces in multiple regions to support your availability requirements. In these cases, ensure that you have appropriate processes in place to manage this increased complexity. |
| Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) when managing multiple workspaces. | Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define the details of your workspaces in [ARM](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/resource-manager-workspace), [BICEP](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/resource-manager-workspace), or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/log_analytics_workspace.html). This allows you to you leverage your existing DevOps processes to deploy new workspaces and [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) to enforce their configuration. |
| Use Log Analytics workspace insights to track the health and performance of your Log Analytics workspaces, and create meaningful and actionable alerts to be proactively notified of operational issues.  | [Log Analytics workspace insights](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design) provides a unified view of the usage, performance, health, agents, queries, and change log for all your workspaces. Review this information on a regular basis to track the health and operation of each of your workspaces.<br><br> Each workspace has an [operation table](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/monitor-workspace) that logs important activities affecting workspace. Create alert rules based on this table to be proactively notified when an operational issue occurs. You can use [recommended alerts for the workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-health) to simplify the creation of the most critical alert rules. |
| Practice continuous improvement by frequently revisiting Azure diagnostic settings on your resources. | Ensure that you’re optimizing your log collection strategy through frequent reviews of your resource settings. From an operational standpoint, look to reduce the noise in your logs by focusing on those logs that provide useful information about a resource’s health status. By optimizing in this manner, you’ll enable operators to more efficiently investigate and troubleshoot issues when they arise, or perform other routine, ad hoc or emergency tasks.<br><br> When new diagnostic categories are made available for a resource type, review the types of logs that are emitted with this category to understand whether enabling them may help you optimize your collection strategy. For example, a new category may be a subset of a larger set of activities that are being captured and the new subset might allow you to reduce the volume of logs coming by focusing on the activities that are important for your operations to track. |

## Performance efficiency
[Performance efficiency](../performance-efficiency/index.yml) is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. Both the workload holistically and individual components in the workload need to be tuned to achieve an efficient status.

It's important to learn the fundamentals of [log data ingestion latency in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time), as understanding these components will provide you with knowledge about what is in your control and what is out of your control for log collection performance.

Use the following information to ensure that your Log Analytics workspaces and log queries are configured for the performance required by your workload and operations.

### Design checklist

> [!div class="checklist"]
> -**Be familiar with fundamentals of [log data ingestion latency in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time).** There are several factors that contribute to latency when ingesting logs into your workspaces and many of these factors are inherent to the Azure Monitor platform. Understanding those factors and the normal latency behavior can help you set appropriate expectations within your organization.
> - **Separate your nonproduction and production workloads.** Having production-specific workspaces will mitigate any overhead that nonproduction systems might introduce and reduce the overall footprint of your workspaces, requiring less resources to handle log data processing
> - **Choose the right deployment regions to meet your performance requirements.** Deploy your Log Analytics workspace and data collection endpoints (DCEs) close to your workload. Your choice of the appropriate region to deploy your workspace and your DCEs in should be informed by your decision-making about where to deploy your workload.  You may need to weigh the performance benefits of deploying your workspaces and DCEs in the same region as your workload against your reliability requirements if you have already deployed your workload into a region that cannot support those requirements for your log data.

### Configuration recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|:---|:---|
| Configure log query auditing and use Log Analytics workspace insights to identify slow and inefficient queries. | [Log query auditing](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/query-audit) stores the compute time required to run each query and the time until results are returned. [Log Analytics workspace insights](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-insights-overview#query-audit-tab) uses this data to list potentially inefficient queries in your workspace. Consider rewriting these queries to improve their performance. Refer to [Optimize log queries in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/query-optimization) for guidance on optimizing your log queries. |
| Understand service limits for Log Analytics workspaces. | In certain high traffic implementations, you may run into service limits that affect your performance and will affect your workspace or workload design. For example, the query API limits the number of records and data volume returned by a query; the Logs ingestion API limits the size of each API call. See [Azure Monitor service limits](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#logs-ingestion-api) for a complete list of limits for Azure Monitor and [Log Analytics workspaces](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#log-analytics-workspaces) for limits specific to the workspace itself.  |
| Create DCR specific to data source type inside the defined observability scope(s). | Create separate DCRs for performance and events to optimize the backend processing compute utilization.<br><br> Not using different DCRs will force each and every associated virtual machine to transfer, process and execute configuration that might be not applicable according to the installed software. An excessive compute resource consumption and errors in processing configuration might happen causing the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) becoming unresponsive. |
